# PZ-MoreMoodles

The goal of this project is to create moodles for giving more feedback on what happens to you in vanilla project zomboid.

It requires the `MoodleFramework` to work. I'd like to thank the creator of this addons for the work done.

This mod is incompatible with `ProteinsMoodle` as of now because I use the same moodle name, but it is somewhat integrated in here ! (you should not use both)
